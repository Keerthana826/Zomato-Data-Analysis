# Zomato-Data-Analysis
This project focuses on Customers and Company, we have to analyze the sentiments of the
reviews given by the customer in the data and make some useful conclusions in the form of
visualizations. Also, cluster the zomato restaurants into different segments. The data is
visualized as it becomes easy to analyze data at instant. The analysis also solves some of
the business cases that can directly help the customers finding the Best restaurant in their
locality and for the company to grow up and work on the fields they are currently lagging in.
This could help in clustering the restaurants into segments. The data has valuable
information around cuisine and costing which can be used in cost vs. benefit analysis Data
could be used for sentiment analysis. The metadata of reviewers can be used for identifying
the critics in the industry.
In this unsupervised machine learning project, we looked into multiple unsupervised models
and sentiment analysis. We started with loading the data, inspecting the data and Data
Cleaning
Through Exploratory Data Analysis, we visualized the data through bar plot, pie chart,
wordcloud and distplots.We have seen a correlation matrix is a table showing correlation
coefficients between variables through heatmap.We have the capped outliers with the
highest and lowest limit using IQR method.
During data pre-processing, we have transformed raw data into an understandable format for
ML algorithms.For textual data pre-processing, NLP pipeline include steps such as sentence
segmentation, word tokenization, lowercasing, stemming or lemmatization, stop word
removal and spelling correction.
Principal Component Analysis was used to reduce the dimensionality of large datasets.
Models like K-means were used for grouping the data into clusters and visualizing them in
clusters. Elbow method and Silhouette score was used to find the optimum number of
clusters.Agglomerative Clustering is a hierarchical clustering algorithm that was used to
cluster the data points. Dendrogram plot was used to find the optimal number of clusters.
For Sentiment Analysis, topic modeling was a technique to extract the hidden topics from
large volumes of text. Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA) is the algorithm that was used for
topic modeling and extracted good quality topics that are clear, segregated and meaningful.
